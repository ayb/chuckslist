-------------------------------------------------
add subdomains (abc_city.chuckslist.org, def_city.chuckslist.org, etc...)

Add some form of CAPTCHA authentication for posting

Add Javascript validation to confirm email address when posting an ad 
(or else redirect them back to the form in a way that is neat and prevents data loss)

Use Paperlip for image attachment to ads and store on Amazon S3

Use SWFUpload for uploading images(http://jimneath.org/2008/05/15/swfupload-paperclip-and-ruby-on-rails.html)

do more to enforce banned authors (ban the IP?)

Add search feature in Admin user management page (admin side)

Clean up model and controller code

Add RSS feed for each category (instead of just a main one)

add more tests (we started strong but then got sidetracked)
