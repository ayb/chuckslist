acts_as_authenticated generator
====

DEPRECATED: Use restful_authentication instead.  Or, ask me for commit rights if you wish to maintain this plugin.

This is a basic authentication generator for rails, very much in the spirit of xal's original Login Generator.

To use:

  ./script/generate authenticated user account

This generates a basic user model, a controller, some basic views, and tests.  Extra functionality can be unlocked by
removing the comments for them.  I have a few examples such as user activation and reversible encrypted passwords.

The user migration is also generated unless you pass --skip-migration.

Generate your mailer:

  ./script/generate authenticated_mailer user
