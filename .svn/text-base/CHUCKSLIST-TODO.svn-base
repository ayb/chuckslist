TODO for v0.2 and beyond (in no particular order)
-------------------------------------------------
1. Add search feature on main chuckslist page (user end)
2. Add search feature in Admin user management page (admin side)
3. Clean up model and controller code
4. Add some form of CAPTCHA authentication for posting
5. Add Javascript validation to confirm email address when posting an ad (or else redirect them back to the form in a way that is neat and prevents data loss)
6. Add RSS feed for each category (instead of just a main one)
7. add ability to upload image(s) with your ad
8. add more tests (we started strong but then got sidetracked)
9. should we consider making ChucksList an ENGINE - such as 
10. ability to flag posts as spam/miscategorized/etc.
11. do more to enforce banned authors (ban the IP?)
12. enhance functions for managing authors and ads in admin section
