    module BenchmarkHelper
      # Allows you to measure the execution time of a block
      # in a template and records the result to the log. Wrap this block around
      # expensive operations or possible bottlenecks to get a time reading
      # for the operation.  For example, let's say you thought your file
      # processing method was taking too long; you could wrap it in a benchmark block.
      #
      #  <% benchmark "Process data files" do %>
      #    <%= expensive_files_operation %>
      #  <% end %>
      #
      # That would add something like "Process data files (0.34523)" to the log,
      # which you can then use to compare timings when optimizing your code.
      #
      # You may give an optional logger level as the second argument
      # (:debug, :info, :warn, :error); the default value is :info.
