  module Helpers
    # Provides a set of helpers for calling Scriptaculous JavaScript
    # functions, including those which create Ajax controls and visual effects.
    #
    # To be able to use these helpers, you must include the Prototype
    # JavaScript framework and the Scriptaculous JavaScript library in your
    # pages. See the documentation for ActionView::Helpers::JavaScriptHelper
    # for more information on including the necessary JavaScript.
    #
    # The Scriptaculous helpers' behavior can be tweaked with various options.
    # See the documentation at http://script.aculo.us for more information on
    # using these helpers in your application.

      # Returns a JavaScript snippet to be used on the Ajax callbacks for
      # starting visual effects.
      #
      # Example:
      #   <%= link_to_remote "Reload", :update => "posts",
      #         :url => { :action => "reload" },
      #         :complete => visual_effect(:highlight, "posts", :duration => 0.5)
      #
      # If no element_id is given, it assumes "element" which should be a local
      # variable in the generated JavaScript execution context. This can be
      # used for example with drop_receiving_element:
      #
      #   <%= drop_receiving_element (...), :loading => visual_effect(:fade) %>
      #
      # This would fade the element that was dropped on the drop receiving
      # element.
      #
      # For toggling visual effects, you can use :toggle_appear, :toggle_slide, and
      # :toggle_blind which will alternate between appear/fade, slidedown/slideup, and
      # blinddown/blindup respectively.
      #
      # You can change the behaviour with various options, see
      # http://script.aculo.us for more documentation.

      # Makes the element with the DOM ID specified by +element_id+ sortable
      # by drag-and-drop and make an Ajax call whenever the sort order has
      # changed. By default, the action called gets the serialized sortable
      # element as parameters.
      #
      # Example:
      #   <%= sortable_element("my_list", :url => { :action => "order" }) %>
      #
      # In the example, the action gets a "my_list" array parameter
      # containing the values of the ids of elements the sortable consists
      # of, in the current order.
      #
      # Important: For this to work, the sortable elements must have id
      # attributes in the form "string_identifier". For example, "item_1". Only
      # the identifier part of the id attribute will be serialized.
      #
      # Additional +options+ are:
      #
      # <tt>:format</tt>::               A regular expression to determine what to send
      #                                  as the serialized id to the server (the default
      #                                  is <tt>/^[^_]*_(.*)$/</tt>).
      #
      # <tt>:constraint</tt>::           Whether to constrain the dragging to either <tt>:horizontal</tt>
      #                                  or <tt>:vertical</tt> (or false to make it unconstrained).
      #
      # <tt>:overlap</tt>::              Calculate the item overlap in the <tt>:horizontal</tt> or
      #                                  <tt>:vertical</tt> direction.
      #
      # <tt>:tag</tt>::                  Which children of the container element to treat as
      #                                  sortable (default is <tt>li</tt>).
      #
      # <tt>:containment</tt>::          Takes an element or array of elements to treat as
      #                                  potential drop targets (defaults to the original
      #                                  target element).
      #
      # <tt>:only</tt>::                 A CSS class name or arry of class names used to filter
      #                                  out child elements as candidates.
      #
      # <tt>:scroll</tt>::               Determines whether to scroll the list during drag
      #                                  operationsif the list runs past the visual border.
      #
      # <tt>:tree</tt>::                 Determines whether to treat nested lists as part of the
      #                                  main sortable list. This means that you can create multi-
      #                                  layer lists, and not only sort items at the same level,
      #                                  but drag and sort items between levels.
      #
      # <tt>:hoverclass</tt>::           If set, the Droppable will have this additional CSS class
      #                                  when an accepted Draggable is hovered over it.
      #
      # <tt>:handle</tt>::               Sets whether the element should only be draggable by an
      #                                  embedded handle. The value may be a string referencing a
      #                                  CSS class value (as of script.aculo.us V1.5). The first
      #                                  child/grandchild/etc. element found within the element
      #                                  that has this CSS class value will be used as the handle.
      #
      # <tt>:ghosting</tt>::             Clones the element and drags the clone, leaving the original
      #                                  in place until the clone is dropped (defaut is <tt>false</tt>).
      #
      # <tt>:dropOnEmpty</tt>::          If set to true, the Sortable container will be made into
      #                                  a Droppable, that can receive a Draggable (as according to
      #                                  the containment rules) as a child element when there are no
      #                                  more elements inside (defaut is <tt>false</tt>).
      #
      # <tt>:onChange</tt>::             Called whenever the sort order changes while dragging. When
      #                                  dragging from one Sortable to another, the callback is
      #                                  called once on each Sortable. Gets the affected element as
      #                                  its parameter.
      #
      # <tt>:onUpdate</tt>::             Called when the drag ends and the Sortable's order is
      #                                  changed in any way. When dragging from one Sortable to
      #                                  another, the callback is called once on each Sortable. Gets
      #                                  the container as its parameter.
      #
