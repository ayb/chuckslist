      # Protect a controller's actions from CSRF attacks by ensuring that all forms are coming from the current web application, not
      # a forged link from another site. This is done by embedding a token based on the session (which an attacker wouldn't know) in
      # all forms and Ajax requests generated by Rails and then verifying the authenticity of that token in the controller. Only
      # HTML/JavaScript requests are checked, so this will not protect your XML API (presumably you'll have a different authentication
      # scheme there anyway). Also, GET requests are not protected as these should be indempotent anyway.
      #
      # You turn this on with the #protect_from_forgery method, which will perform the check and raise
      # an ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken if the token doesn't match what was expected. And it will add
      # a _authenticity_token parameter to all forms that are automatically generated by Rails. You can customize the error message
      # given through public/422.html.

      # Keep in mind, this is NOT a silver-bullet, plug 'n' play, warm security blanket for your rails application.
      # There are a few guidelines you should follow:
      #
      # * Keep your GET requests safe and idempotent.  More reading material:
      #   * http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/04/24/deviant.html
      #   * http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.1
      # * Make sure the session cookies that Rails creates are non-persistent.  Check in Firefox and look for "Expires: at end of session"
      #
      # If you need to construct a request yourself, but still want to take advantage of forgery protection, you can grab the
      # authenticity_token using the form_authenticity_token helper method and make it part of the parameters yourself.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #   class FooController < ApplicationController
      #     # uses the cookie session store (then you don't need a separate :secret)
      #     protect_from_forgery :except => :index
      #
      #     # uses one of the other session stores that uses a session_id value.
      #     protect_from_forgery :secret => 'my-little-pony', :except => :index
      #
      #     # you can disable csrf protection on controller-by-controller basis:
      #     skip_before_filter :verify_authenticity_token
      #   end
      #
      # If you are upgrading from Rails 1.x, disable forgery protection to
      # simplify your tests. Add this to config/environments/test.rb:
      #
      #   # Disable request forgery protection in test environment
      #   config.action_controller.allow_forgery_protection = false
      #
      # Valid Options:
      #
      # * <tt>:only/:except</tt> - passed to the before_filter call.  Set which actions are verified.
      # * <tt>:secret</tt> - Custom salt used to generate the form_authenticity_token.
      #   Leave this off if you are using the cookie session store.
      # * <tt>:digest</tt> - Message digest used for hashing.  Defaults to 'SHA1'
