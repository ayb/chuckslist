module ActionController #:nodoc:
  # Cookies are read and written through ActionController#cookies. The cookies being read are what were received along with the request,
  # the cookies being written are what will be sent out with the response. Cookies are read by value (so you won't get the cookie object
  # itself back -- just the value it holds). Examples for writing:
  #
  #   cookies[:user_name] = "david" # => Will set a simple session cookie
  #   cookies[:login] = { :value => "XJ-122", :expires => 1.hour.from_now }
  #   # => Will set a cookie that expires in 1 hour
  #
  # Examples for reading:
  #
  #   cookies[:user_name] # => "david"
  #   cookies.size         # => 2
  #
  # Example for deleting:
  #
  #   cookies.delete :user_name
  #
  # All the option symbols for setting cookies are:
  #
  # * <tt>value</tt> - the cookie's value or list of values (as an array).
  # * <tt>path</tt> - the path for which this cookie applies.  Defaults to the root of the application.
  # * <tt>domain</tt> - the domain for which this cookie applies.
  # * <tt>expires</tt> - the time at which this cookie expires, as a +Time+ object.
  # * <tt>secure</tt> - whether this cookie is a secure cookie or not (default to false).
  #                     Secure cookies are only transmitted to HTTPS servers.
  # * <tt>http_only</tt> - whether this cookie is accessible via scripting or only HTTP (defaults to false).
