# == Generating UUIDs
#
# Call UUID.new to generate and return a new UUID. The method returns a string in one of three
# formats. The default format is 36 characters long, and contains the 32 hexadecimal octets and
# hyphens separating the various value parts. The <tt>:compact</tt> format omits the hyphens,
# while the <tt>:urn</tt> format adds the <tt>:urn:uuid</tt> prefix.
#
# For example:
#  10.times do
#    p UUID.new
#  end
#
# ---
# == UUIDs in Brief
#
# UUID (universally unique identifier) are guaranteed to be unique across time and space.
#
# A UUID is 128 bit long, and consists of a 60-bit time value, a 16-bit sequence number and
# a 48-bit node identifier.
#
# The time value is taken from the system clock, and is monotonically incrementing. However,
# since it is possible to set the system clock backward, a sequence number is added. The
# sequence number is incremented each time the UUID generator is started. The combination
# guarantees that identifiers created on the same machine are unique with a high degree of
# probability.
#
# Note that due to the structure of the UUID and the use of sequence number, there is no
# guarantee that UUID values themselves are monotonically incrementing. The UUID value
# cannot itself be used to sort based on order of creation.
#
# To guarantee that UUIDs are unique across all machines in the network, use the IEEE 802
# MAC address of the machine's network interface card as the node identifier. Network interface
# cards have unique MAC address that are 47-bit long (the last bit acts as a broadcast flag).
# Use +ipconfig+ (Windows), or +ifconfig+ (Unix) to find the MAC address (aka physical address)
# of a network card. It takes the form of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by hypen or
# colon, e.g. '<tt>08-0E-46-21-4B-35</tt>'
#
# For more information see {RFC 4122}[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt].
#
# == Configuring the UUID generator
#
# The UUID generator requires a state file which maintains the MAC address and next sequence
# number to use. By default, the UUID generator will use the file <tt>uuid.state</tt> contained
# in the current directory.
#
# Use UUID.config to specify a different location for the UUID state file. If the UUID state file
# does not exist, you can create one manually, or use UUID.config with the options <tt>:sequence</tt>
# and <tt>:mac_addr</tt>.
#
# A UUID state file looks like:
#   ---
#   last_clock: "0x28227f76122d80"
#   mac_addr: 08-0E-46-21-4B-35
#   sequence: "0x1639"
#
#--
# === Time-based UUID
#
# The UUID specification prescribes the following format for representing UUIDs. Four octets encode
# the low field of the time stamp, two octects encode the middle field of the timestamp, and two
# octets encode the high field of the timestamp with the version number. Two octets encode the
# clock sequence number and six octets encode the unique node identifier.
#
# The timestamp is a 60 bit value holding UTC time as a count of 100 nanosecond intervals since
# October 15, 1582. UUIDs generated in this manner are guaranteed not to roll over until 3400 AD.
#
# The clock sequence is used to help avoid duplicates that could arise when the clock is set backward
# in time or if the node ID changes. Although the system clock is guaranteed to be monotonic, the
# system clock is not guaranteed to be monotonic across system failures. The UUID cannot be sure
# that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than the current timestamp.
#
# If the clock sequence can be determined at initialization, it is incremented by one. The clock sequence
# MUST be originally (i.e. once in the lifetime of a system) initialized to a random number to minimize the
# correlation across systems. The initial value must not be correlated to the node identifier.
#
# The node identifier must be unique for each UUID generator. This is accomplished using the IEEE 802
# network card address. For systems with multiple IEEE 802 addresses, any available address can be used.
# For systems with no IEEE address, a 47 bit random value is used and the multicast bit is set so it will
# never conflict with addresses obtained from network cards.
#
# === UUID state file
#
# The UUID state is contained in the UUID state file. The file name can be specified when configuring
# the UUID generator with UUID.config. The default is to use the file +uuid.state+ in the current directory.
#
# The UUID state file is read once when the UUID generator is first used (or configured). The sequence
# number contained in the UUID is read and used, and the state file is updated to the next sequence
# number. The MAC address is also read from the state file. The current clock time (in 100ns resolution)
# is stored in the state file whenever the sequence number is updated, but is never read.
#
# If the UUID generator detects that the system clock has been moved backwards, it will obtain a new
# sequence in the same manner. So it is possible that the UUID state file will be updated while the
# application is running.
